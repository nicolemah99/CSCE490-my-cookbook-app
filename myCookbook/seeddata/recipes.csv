nicole,Baked Brie,Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F:Unwrap brie and place in a small; shallow ovenproof dish slightly larger than the brie (to be used for serving).:Bake for 15 to 20 minutes (for 250g/80z); or until melted through. For 500g/1lb brie; increase to 25 minutes. To check; gently touch the centre of the brie – it should feel very soft; like it is about to collapse if you press any harder.:Carefully transfer to serving plate / board – it's delicate (transfer on paper if you used paper).:Drizzle with honey; top with sprig of thyme (if using).:Serve immediately with crostini on the side for scooping. Provide a knife to cut through the rind and a cheese or pate knife (or similar) to scoop cheese up onto crostini or crackers (plain or fruit/nut flavoured).,round brie:16:oz:honey:2:Tb:thyme sprig:1:NA:crostini crackers:20:NA:purple grape bunch:1:NA,The world's fastest finger food; this is like the best cheese dip in the world with wow factor! Just pop a brie in the oven for 15 minutes or microwave on high for 2 minutes (seriously; no one will EVER know). Use a budget brie or camember for this; top end brie would be wasted on this recipe.Excellent shared entree or party food that's really quick and easy to prepare. Be sure to use sturdy plain or flavoured crackers; or crostini for scooping. Wafer thin crackers and chips tend to break.,10,18,myCookbook/images/recipeImages/bakedbrie.jpeg
tuvag,Pasta Carbonara,Add bacon and 1/2 cup of the water to a large non-stick skillet and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.:Allow to simmer until water evaporates about 6 - 7 minutes; then reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until bacon is brown and crisp; about 6 - 8 minutes longer.:Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl then pour bacon into strainer while reserving about 1 tsp of the rendered fat in pan; Return pan to heat and saute garlic about 30 seconds; until fragrant and lightly golden.:Pour into a medium mixing bowl then add 1 Tbsp rendered bacon fat (drippings in bowl set under strainer) to mixing bowl with garlic. Add eggs; egg yolk; parmesan and pepper to garlic mixture and whisk until well combined.:Meanwhile; bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a large dutch oven (no more than 8 cups because you want a very starchy water for the sauce). Add spaghetti and salt to boiling water and cook until al dente. While pasta is boiling; set a colander in a large bowl.:Carefully drain al dente pasta into colander in bowl; while reserving pasta water in bowl. Measure out 1 cup hot pasta water and discard remaining water. Immediately place pasta in now empty large bowl.:Slowly pour and whisk 1/2 cup pasta water into egg mixture; then slowly pour mixture over pasta while tossing to coat. Add bacon and toss to combine.

It’s the perfect go-to for a busy weeknight; and it’s also a dish fit for the weekend or even to serve to guests.It seems like one of those dinners with so few ingredients that how could you possibly mess it up; but oh how you can if you aren’t using with the right method. I’m no expert on carbonara; which is why I turned to Cook’s Illustrated; they are the kitchen geniuses. This recipe works so well because pasta is boiled in less water with to really concentrate the starches; which will help bind everything in the sauce and prevent separation when you add it to the egg mixture. Another helpful tip is that the bacon is simmered in water first. Bacon seems easy to burn or can cook unevenly in a skillet; and pieces stick. But when going this route and cooking it in water first; it works like a charm. And lastly this recipe contains the perfect ratio of eggs and yolks (or one yolk in this case) to have the perfect carbonara; custard-rich flavor and the perfect consistency. Recipe originally lists Romano cheese; but I always have Parmesan on hand so I went with that to keep the simple weeknight meal idea here; but I’m sure Romano would also be delicious. Better yet; use half of each. Just be sure it’s freshly grated. Enjoy!,6,35,myCookbook/images/recipeImages/carbonara.jpeg
