nicole,Chicken & Biscuits Bake,Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).:In a large pot over medium-high heat;melt the butter.:Add the onion; stir until softened.

nicole,Baked Brie,Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F:Unwrap brie and place in a small; shallow ovenproof dish slightly larger than the brie (to be used for serving).:Bake for 15 to 20 minutes (for 250g/80z); or until melted through. For 500g/1lb brie; increase to 25 minutes. To check; gently touch the centre of the brie – it should feel very soft; like it is about to collapse if you press any harder.:Carefully transfer to serving plate / board – it's delicate (transfer on paper if you used paper).:Drizzle with honey; top with sprig of thyme (if using).:Serve immediately with crostini on the side for scooping. Provide a knife to cut through the rind and a cheese or pate knife (or similar) to scoop cheese up onto crostini or crackers (plain or fruit/nut flavoured).,round brie:16:oz:honey:2:Tb:thyme sprig:1:NA:crostini crackers:20:NA:purple grape bunch:1:NA,The world's fastest finger food; this is like the best cheese dip in the world with wow factor! Just pop a brie in the oven for 15 minutes or microwave on high for 2 minutes (seriously; no one will EVER know). Use a budget brie or camember for this; top end brie would be wasted on this recipe.Excellent shared entree or party food that's really quick and easy to prepare. Be sure to use sturdy plain or flavoured crackers; or crostini for scooping. Wafer thin crackers and chips tend to break.,10,18,myCookbook/images/recipeImages/bakedbrie.jpeg
